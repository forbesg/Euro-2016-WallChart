# Euro 2016 WallChart

### A digital interactive wallchart for the Euro 2016 football championships

Complete the scores as the tournament progresses.

The application will update the group tables based upon the scores that have been inputed.

The group winners, runners-up and eligible third place teams will be automatically pushed to the knockout phase of the competition.

Data is stored in the browsers local storage so that completed data will be saved between sessions. I am currently
looking at creating a Chrome App which will allow the use of chrome.storage API enabling the stored data to
be synced between chrome browsers that the user is signed in to.

The application is built with Angular in a hurry.
